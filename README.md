## Introduction
After asking a close relative who works in a bank, a problem arose where a program was needed to prevent bank customerâ€™s information from being leaked by potential hackers due to phone fraud. At the same time, the program is capable of compressing customer information so that the database can store more confidential data. To address this problem, we aim to develop a C program that allowing users to store compressed and password protected files in one specific directory. The user may pass a document to the program, which encrypts the documents using a specific password. When required the user can decompress and decrypt the files through the program. It may also come with an advanced search feature that looks for a specific keyword within an encrypted and compressed file. And it can also sort the original dataset by the specific numerical column.
